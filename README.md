# **CSC3231 Coursework - Alien Landscape Simulation 🌌**

## **Overview**
This project is a **Unity-based 3D simulation** inspired by the films **"2001: A Space Odyssey"** and **"Blade Runner 2049"**. The goal is to create an **alien landscape** that captures the atmosphere of a **deserted but majestic orange planet**, featuring:
- **Harsh extraterrestrial terrain** with swirling fog and billowing clouds 🌫️
- **Abandoned spacecraft**, hinting at a past exploration mission 🚀
- **Petrified trees and bushes**, reinforcing the planet’s **inhospitable nature** 🌳
- **Dynamic water bodies**, including a lake and a cascading waterfall 🌊
- **Realistic weather effects**, such as atmospheric fog and moving clouds ☁️
- **Interactive elements**, including a rolling tumbleweed driven by physics 🎮

## **Features**
✅ **Procedural Environment Design**: Utilizes Unity’s **Asset Store resources** and custom modifications  
✅ **Advanced Particle Effects**: Implements **fog, clouds, mist, and water ripples**  
✅ **Realistic Water Simulation**: Created using **Unity’s particle system** and shader effects  
✅ **Custom 3D Models**: Abandoned spacecraft built using **mesh generation & rasterization**  
✅ **Physics-Based Tumbleweed Animation**: Uses **C# scripting** to simulate movement and collision

## **Technical Details**
### **1. Environment Design 🌍**
- Uses **Dream Forest Tree (IL.ranch)** and **Outdoor Ground Textures (A Dog’s Life Software)**.
- Modified assets to remove greenery and emphasize **a barren, hostile planet**.

### **2. Water Simulation 💧**
- **Cascading waterfall & lake** created with Unity’s **particle system**.
- Water ripples and mist effects add **realism and depth**.

### **3. Custom Spaceship Model 🚀**
- Built using **mesh generation & rasterization**.
- Designed as a **triangular grid structure** for realism.

### **4. Atmospheric Effects ☁️**
- **Fog and clouds** strategically placed for depth and immersion.
- Fog creates the illusion of an **infinitely extending planetary surface**.

### **5. Dynamic Tumbleweed Animation 🎮**
- **C# scripting** applied to control **rotation, gravity, and collision**.
- Moves naturally across the terrain, reinforcing **isolation & desolation**.

## **Future Enhancements**
- ✅ **Procedural Terrain Generation** for larger-scale environments  
- ✅ **Day & Night Cycle** to simulate planetary time changes  
- ✅ **AI-driven Alien Creatures** to add interactive elements
